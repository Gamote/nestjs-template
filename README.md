# Nest.js Template

A quick way to get going with stuff that I would do in any Nest.js project.

Highlights:
- Typescript (with strict mode)
- ESLint + Prettier (custom rules)
- Fastify instead of Express
- Typed `ConfigModule` using `zod`
- Auto-validation pipe using `class-validator`
- NVM (latest LTS)
